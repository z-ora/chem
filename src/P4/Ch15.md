# Concentration of solutions


**how many grams of solute per dm3 of solution?**

$g\ dm^{-3} = \dfrac{mass\ of\ solute\ (g)}{volume\ of\ solution\ (dm^3)}$


**how many mols of solute per dm3 of solution?**

Molarity M = $mol\ dm^{-3} = \dfrac{mol\ of\ solute\ (mol)}{volume\ of\ solution\ (dm^3)}$

> **Since** $mass(g) \div molar\ mass = mols$
> 
> $\therefore g\ dm^{-3} \div molar\ mass = mol\ dm^{-3}$ Molarity M

**Naming**
- a molar solution has molarity of 1M
- a decimolar solution has a molarity of 0.1M

**Example** Calculate the molarity of:
1. 5.85g of NaCl in 200cm3 of solution
	- $[NaCl] = \dfrac{5.85 \div 40.1}{\frac{200}{1000}} = 1.00M$
2. NaOH in concentration of 80 g dm-3
	- $[NaOH] = \dfrac{80}{40} = 2M$

**Example** Calculate the molarity of constituent ions in 0.5 M aluminium sulphate solution?
- aluminium sulphate is $Al_2(SO_4)_3$
- 2 + 3 = 5 (there are 5 mol of ions per mol of compound)
- required molarity = 0.5M * 5 = 2.5 M

## Dilution
On dilution with water, the number of moles of the solute remains constant.
$$
\begin{align}
mol_1 &= mol_2 \\
M_1V_1 &= M_2V_2
\end{align}
$$

**Example** What volume of water should be added to dilute 100cm3 of 5M HCl to 2M HCl?
$$
\begin{align}
M_1V_1 &= M_2V_2 \\
5 \times 100 &= 2 \times V_2 \\
V_2 &= 250 cm^3 \\ \\
\therefore water\ added = 250 - 100 &= 150 cm^3
\end{align}
$$
