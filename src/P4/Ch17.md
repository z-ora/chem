# Strength
Strength of an acid / alkali is the degree of ionization of the acid / alkali in water.

How to compare strength?
- measure the pH value
	- stronger acid/alkali has a lower/higher pH as it contains more mobile ions
- measure the electrical conductivity
	- stronger acid/alkali has a higher electrical conductivity as it contains more mobile ions
- compare the reactivity
