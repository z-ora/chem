# Acids

- Most dilute acid solutions have a sour taste
- Acids are electrolytes
- Acids are corrosive

The basicity of an acid is the maximum number of hydrogen ions produced by one molecule of the acid.
- monobasic / dibasic / tribasic / etc.
## Role of water
Water must be present for acids to show its acidic properties.It is because acids **ionizes** in water to form hydrogen ions, which are responsible for the acidic properties.

Strong acids
- hydrochloric acid $HCl \rightleftharpoons H^+ + Cl^-$
- sulphuric acid $H_2SO_4 \rightleftharpoons 2H^+ + SO_4^{2-}$
- nitric acid $HNO_3 \rightleftharpoons H^+ + NO_3^-$

Weak acids
- ethanoic acid $CH_3COOH \rightleftharpoons H^+ + CH_3COO^-$ (ethanoate ion)
- carbonic acid $H_2CO_3 \rightleftharpoons 2H^+ + CO_3^{2-}$
- sulphurous acid $H_2SO_3 \rightleftharpoons 2H^+ + SO_3^{2-}$
- nitrous acid $HNO_2 \rightleftharpoons H^+ + NO_2^-$

## Corrosive concentrated acids

- concentrated $HCl$: (g) normally, (aq) when dissolved in water
- concentrated $H_2SO_4$
	- non-volatile, colourless oily liquid
	- great affinity for water
		- physical: hygroscopic (absorb moisture from the atmosphere but do not dissolve in it)
		- chemical: dehydrating (forcefully pull H and O from molecules)
	- oxidizing
- concentrated $HNO_3$
	- volatile, colourless liquid
	- dissolved $NO_2$ forms from its decomposition, often turns brown on storage
		- light speeds up its decomposition, should be kept in brown bottle
	- oxidizing

## Reaction with metals

> metal + acid â†’ salt + hydrogen
- the metal has to be more reactive than copper

Observations
- the metal dissolves
- gives a colourless/coloured solution
- colourless gas bubbles evolve

### Examples
- $Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) \rightarrow MgCl_2(aq) + H_2(g)$
	- Mg dissolves, gives a colourless solution and colourless gas bubbles evolve.
- $Zn(s) + H_2SO_4(aq) \rightarrow ZnSO_4(aq) + H_2(g)$
	- Zn dissolves, gives a colourless solution and colourless gas bubbles evolve.

### Exception in acids: Oxidizing power
Some acids gain oxidizing power **and react with copper too**.

- **concentrated** sulphuric acid
	- sulphuric dioxide $SO_2(g)$ is released (colourless gas)
	- $Zn(s) + 2H_2SO_4(aq) \rightarrow ZnSO_4(aq) + SO_2(g) + 2H_2O(l)$
- **dilute** nitric acid
	- nitrogen oxide $NO(g)$ is released (colourless gas)
	- nitrogen oxide reacts with oxygen in the air to form nitrogen dioxide (brown gas)
	- $2NO(g) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2NO_2(g)$
- **concentrated** nitric acid
	- nitrogen dioxide $NO_2(g)$ is released (colourless gas)

**Remark:** very dilute nitric acid does not have oxidizing power.

### Exception in metals: Solubility

- $PbCl_2$/$PbSO_4$ is **insoluble** in water
	- $Pb + 2HCl \rightarrow PbCl_2 + H_2$
	- Observation: Lead reacts slowly with $HCl$ and the reaction finally stops.
	- Explanation: $PbCl_2$ is insoluble and **formed a coat on the metal**, stopping further reaction.
	- same applies to $PbSO_4$
- $CaSO_4$ is **sparingly soluble** in water
	- $Ca + H_2SO_4 \rightarrow CaSO_4 + H_2$
	- Observation: Calcium reacts slowly with $H_2SO_4$
