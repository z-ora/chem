# Indicators and pH

A solution can be acidic, neutral, or alkaline.

Definition: $pH = -log [H^+(aq)]$

ie. $[H^+(aq)] = 10^{-pH}$

| Comparison               | pH     | Solution is ... |
| ------------------------ | ------ | --------------- |
| $[H^+(aq)] > [OH^-(aq)]$ | pH < 7 | acidic          |
| $[H^+(aq)] = [OH^-(aq)]$ | pH = 7 | neutral         |
| $[H^+(aq)] < [OH^-(aq)]$ | pH > 7 | alkaline        |

**Important** both $H^+$ and $OH^-$ must be present.

> **pH of water**
> 
> Water undergoes self-ionization: $H_2O(l) \rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$
> 
> In water, $[H^+(aq)] = [OH^-(aq)] = 10^7 M$
> 
> Therefore, $pH = 7$

pH can be measured by using:
- universal indicator
- pH meter
- pH paper

**Example** Does the pH change in the following cases?
1. A piece of magnesium ribbon is added to dilute hydrochloric acid.
	- $Mg + 2HCl \rightarrow MgCl_2 + H_2$
	- $H^+$ is reacted in the reaction.
	- $[H^+(aq)]$ decreases, so the pH increases.
2. Hydrogen chloride gas is dissolved in water.
	- $HCl(g) \rightarrow HCl(aq) \rightarrow H^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq)$
	- $[H^+(aq)]$ increases, so the pH decreases.
