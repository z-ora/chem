# (5) Atomic Structure


## Elements

Definition: An element is a pure substance which cannot be broken down into anything simpler by chemical methods.

Most abundant elements in the Earth's crust: oxygen(50%), silicon(26%), aluminium(7%), iron(4%)

## Classification of elements
Elements can be classified into metals, non-metals, and semi-metals.

| Property                                         | Metals                                              | Non-metals                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| physical state at room temp and pressure         | solid<br>**Exception:** Hg is liquid                | solid or gas<br>**Exception:** Br is liquid                                        |
| appearance                                       | shiny                                               | dull<br>**Exception:** diamond is shiny                                            |
| melting and boiling points                       | high<br>**Exception:** Na and Hg have low mp and bp | low<br>**Exception:** diamond and graphite have high bp and bp                     |
| hardness and strength                            | hard and strong<br>**Exception:** Na is soft        | brittle<br>**Exception:** diamond is strong                                        |
| malleability and ductility                       | malleable and ductile                               | not malleable and not ductile                                                      |
| density                                          | high<br>**Exception:** Na low                       | low                                                                                |
| thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity | good conductors of heat and electricity             | poor conductors of heat and electricity<br>**Exception:** graphite is good in both |

**Remark**
- hardness - resist changing shape
- strength - resist breaking apart
- malleable - can be hammered into sheets
- ductile - can be drawn into wires

## Semi-metals
Semi-metals have properties of both metals and non-metals.

Examples: boron(B), silicon(Si)

When they are heated or slightly impure, they conduct electricity quite well. (They are semi-conductors)

## Atoms

Definition: An atom is the smallest part of an element which has the chemical properties of that element.

**Structure of an atom**
- the nucleus contains protons and neutrons packed tightly together
	- proton (p): relative mass **defined** to be 1, electric charge = +1
	- neutron (n): relative mass = 1, electric charge = 0
- electrons move very fast around the nucleus
	- electron ($e^-$): negligible mass, electric charge = -1

**Important:** an atom must be neutral, ie having the same number of protons and electrons

**Numbers describing an atom**
- **Atomic number (Z)** of an atom is the number or protons in the atom
	- each element has its own unique atomic number
- **Mass number (A)** of an atom is the sum of number of protons and neutrons in the atom
	- number of protons may **NOT** equal to number of neutrons, see isotopes below
The full atomic symbol: $^A_ZX$

## Isotopes
Definition: Isotopes are different atoms of the same element, with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.

**Important concept**
- We don't say "atom X is an isotope"
- Instead, we need to compare: "atom X and Y are isotopes"
- or, relative to an element: "atom Z is an isotope of hydrogen"

**Example: isotopes of hydrogen**

| Isotopes   | Mass number A | protons | neutrons | electrons |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
| Hydrogen-1 | 1 (1+0)       | 1       | 0        | 1         |
| Hydrogen-2 | 2 (1+1)       | 1       | 1        | 1         |
| Hydrogen-3 | 3 (1+2)       | 1       | 2        | 1         |

## Relative abundance
In most cases, isotopes of the same element have different abundance.

**Example: isotopes of carbon**

| Isotope   | Relative abundance in nature |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| Carbon-12 | 98.892%                      |
| Carbon-13 | 1.108%                       |
| Carbon-14 | very small %                 |
