# The Periodic Table
Elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number.

Period = horizontal, number of occupied electron shells
Group = vertical, number of outermost shell electrons

| Group     | Name                  |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Group I   | Alkali metals         |
| Group II  | Alkaline earth metals |
| Group VII | Halogens              |
| Group 0   | Noble gases           |

**Example** Element X has an electronic arrangement of 2, 8, 18, 7. Element Y has an atomic number of 17.
1. To which period and group of the Periodic Table does X belong?
	- Period 4, Group VII
2. What is the special name given to this group?
	- Halogens
3. By referring to the Periodic Table, name element X and Y.
	- X is bromine and Y is chlorine.
4. Do X and Y have similar chemical properties? Explain your answer.
	- Yes. Both of them belong to Group VII. They have the same number of electrons in the outermost shell.
5. Compare the reactivity between X and Y.
	- X is more reactive than Y.

## Patterns

Group I
- shiny and soft
- tarnish easily in air (forming metal oxide)
- low density, mp, bp
- react with water vigorously to give hydrogen gas and alkaline solution

| Metal | Reaction with water                                                                                                           |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Li    | floats, producing hydrogen gas steadily                                                                                       |
| Na    | melts to form a silvery ball that moves about quickly on the water surface, producing hydrogen gas rapidly                    |
| K     | melts to form a silvery ball that moves about quickly on the water surface, producing hydrogen gas and catches fire by itself |
| Rb Cs | Explosive reaction                                                                                                            |

Group II
- shiny ahd soft but harder than Group I
- tarnish easily in air (forming metal oxide)
- react with water to give hydrogen gas and alkaline solution (less reactive than Group I)
	- one more proton, stronger attractive force between nucleus and the outermost electrons
	- have to lose 2 electrons

| Metal | Reaction with water                                                  |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Be    | does not react with water or steam                                   |
| Mg    | almost no reaction with water, reacts with steam to produce hydrogen |
| Ca    | reacts steadily with water to produce hydrogen                       |
| Sr    | reacts vigorously with water                                         |
| Ba    | reacts even more vigorously with water                               |

Group VII
- toxic and coloured
- mp bp increases down the group
- reactivity decreases down the group

| Halogen | Appearance          | Reaction with hydrogen                                         |
| ------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| F       | Pale yellow gas     | reacts explosively in the dark                                 |
| Cl      | Yellowish green gas | reacts explosively in sunlight, slow reaction in the dark      |
| Br      | Brown liquid        | reacts only in sunlight / heated                               |
| I       | black/purple solid  | virtually no reaction even in direct sunlight / strong heating |
| At      | black solid         | does not react with hydrogen                                   |

Group 0
- colourless gasses
- attained a stable octet structure (except helium: duplet structure)
- stable
- density increases down the group

| Noble gas | Use                                   | Reason                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Helium He | Fill weather balloons and airship     | - lower density than air<br>- does not burn (unreactive) |
| Neon Ne   | Fill light bulbs in advertising signs | glow red when electricity is passed through it           |
| Argon Ar  | fill light bulbs                      | does not react with the metal filament in the bulb       |
