# Elements

Definition: An element is a pure substance which cannot be broken down into anything simpler by chemical methods.

Most abundant elements in the Earth's crust: oxygen(50%), silicon(26%), aluminium(7%), iron(4%)

## Classification of elements
Elements can be classified into metals, non-metals, and semi-metals.

| Property                                         | Metals                                              | Non-metals                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| physical state at room temp and pressure         | solid<br>**Exception:** Hg is liquid                | solid or gas<br>**Exception:** Br is liquid                                        |
| appearance                                       | shiny                                               | dull<br>**Exception:** diamond is shiny                                            |
| melting and boiling points                       | high<br>**Exception:** Na and Hg have low mp and bp | low<br>**Exception:** diamond and graphite have high bp and bp                     |
| hardness and strength                            | hard and strong<br>**Exception:** Na is soft        | brittle<br>**Exception:** diamond is strong                                        |
| malleability and ductility                       | malleable and ductile                               | not malleable and not ductile                                                      |
| density                                          | high<br>**Exception:** Na low                       | low                                                                                |
| thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity | good conductors of heat and electricity             | poor conductors of heat and electricity<br>**Exception:** graphite is good in both |

**Remark**
- hardness - resist changing shape
- strength - resist breaking apart
- malleable - can be hammered into sheets
- ductile - can be drawn into wires

## Semi-metals
Semi-metals have properties of both metals and non-metals.

Examples: boron(B), silicon(Si)

When they are heated or slightly impure, they conduct electricity quite well. (They are semi-conductors)

## *Example*

Consider the following substances:

(a) Diamond, (b) Oxygen gas. (c) Water. (d) Steel

(e) Silicon, (f) Plastic, (g) Chlorine gas, (h) Iron

1. Which of them is/are elements?
2. Among the elements in (1), which of them is/are NOT a metal?
3. Among the elements in (2), which of them is a semi-metal?
4. In what conditions does the element in (3) conduct electricity?

**Answer**
1. Which of them is/are elements?
	- (a) Diamond, (b) Oxygen gas, (e) Silicon, (g) Chlorine gas, (h) Iron
	- Note: elements contain only one kind of atom; water, steel, plastic contain multiple
2. Among the elements in (1), which of them is/are NOT a metal?
	- (b) Oxygen gas, (e) Silicon, (g) Chlorine gas
3. Among the elements in (2), which of them is a semi-metal?
	- (e) Silicon
4. In what conditions does the element in (3) conduct electricity?
	- When heated or slightly impure
