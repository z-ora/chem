## Relative isotopic mass

On a $^{12}C = 12.00$ scale:

$relative\ isotopic\ mass = \dfrac{mass}{\dfrac{1}{12} \times mass\ of\ ^{12}C}$

## Relative atomic mass

$relative\ atomic\ mass = \sum{n\%m_n}$
It is the weighted average of mass by relative abundance.

**Example** Consider silicon.

| Atom       | Abundance |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Silicon-28 | 92.23%    |
| Silicon-29 | 4.67%     |
| Silicon-30 | 3.10%     |

Find the relative atomic mass of Si.
- $92.23\%\times 28 + 4.67\%\times 29 + 3.10\%\times 30 = 28.1$

**Example** (2324F4UTQ2)

Neon has two isotopes in a sample: $^{20}Ne$ and $^{22}Ne$. The relative atomic mass of neon is 20.2.
1. What is meant by the term "isotope"?
	- Isotopes are atoms of the same element with the same number of protons but different number of neutrons.
2. Calculate the relative abundance of the $^{22}Ne$ isotope.
	- Let x% be the required relative abundance.
	- (1 - x%)(20) + (x%)(22) = 20.2
	- x = 10
	- $\therefore$ the relative abundance of $^{22}Ne$ is 10%
3. Explain whether it is possible to separate the isotopes of neon by chemical means.
	- No, as the isotopes of neon have the same chemical properties
